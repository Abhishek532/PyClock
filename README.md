# Alarm Clock in Python
A basic shell based alarm clock in python
## About
This program works by handling date and time formats using the **datetime** library and by comparing the current dekstop time with the time provided by the user. The program also asks the user if they want to wake up to a pleasant sound or to a loud and aggressive sound. The code automatically chooses a random sound from one of the categories chosen by the user and plays it when the alarm rings.
